This is the capstone project for the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?) available through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)

For my capstone, I chose to complete Track 1 with the *Cyclistic* bike-share case study. Background information and data can be found in the **Info** folder. Data is also available [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

**Note:** This data is made available by [Divvy Bikes](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) for use, the name of the company has just been changed.
